# 3D-Generated-Maze

Welcome to SE480: The Maze Game. This is a simple maze runner game that takes place 
in a square-grid maze generated procedurally with a random seed. The player starts 
in one corner, which can be viewed as the bottom left of the maze, and must find 
their way to the end of the maze in the other corner, which can be viewed as the 
top right.

However, the finish tile of the maze is covered by a barrier called a lockblock. 
The lockblock prevents the player from completing the maze. The lockblock can be 
removed from the finish tile if the player finds the key, which is placed in a random 
location somewhere in the maze. The key is picked up by running into it.
As an additional challenge, the player can collect 5 gold gems scattered around the 
maze in a similar manner. They are also picked up the same way. Gold gems are not 
required to complete the maze.

The player character appears in the center of the screen, and is controlled with the 
WASD keys, similarly to many computer games. The camera angle is controlled by the 
computer mouse.

Once the player finishes, they can record their score in the hi score table. The 
object of the game is to achieve a new high score!
